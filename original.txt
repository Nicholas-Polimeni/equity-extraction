Uncovering Neighborhood-level Portfolios of Corporate 
Single-Family Rental Holdings and Wealth Impact

Introduction
Home equity is the most important financial vehicle for the typical American family to build wealth (Goodman, 2003; Rappaport, 2010); in 2023, the median household held 45% of its wealth in home equity. This proportion rises to 63% and 66% for Black and Hispanic homeowners, respectively (Kochhar & Moslimani, 2023). Studies confirm that this pattern has been robust over the years. For instance, a HUD study tracking household wealth from 1984 to 1992 found that low-income and minority households relied primarily on home equity for wealth accumulation (Boehm & Schlottmann, 2008). Like the HUD study, both Herbert et al. (2013) and Wainer and Zabel (2020) use multiple waves of PSID (Panel Study of Income Dynamics) data spanning 1999-2009 and 1984-2013, respectively, to show that homeownership remains an effective means for low-income and minority households to build wealth.
Given the importance of homeownership and equity, it is unsurprising that the Great Recession disproportionately affected low-income and minority homeowners. Between mid-2007 and 2009, US households lost an estimated 7.4 trillion dollars of home equity.1 The average net worth of African American and non-White Hispanic households shrank by 37.2%, three times higher than other race and ethnic groups (Emmons & Noeth, 2012). During this period, 5.4 million single-family (SF) homes, once owner-occupied, became rentals (Terrazas, 2017), and homeownership fell from a peak of 69.2% in 2006 to 62.9% in 2016 (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, n.d.). 
Simultaneously, the crisis precipitated the wholesale purchase of SF homes by institutional and other corporate investors (Fields, 2018; Fields & Vergerio, 2022; Immergluck & Law, 2014; Mills et al., 2019; Christophers, 2023). Investors converted many of the acquired homes into single-family rentals (SFRs) as a new business model. Enabled by new financial and management tools (Fields & Vergerio, 2022; Mills et al., 2019),  firms with at least 100 SFRs in their portfolio collectively owned around 600,000 properties nationwide as of 2022 (Goodman et al., 2023). 
Century-long segregationist housing policies and urban development, such as racial covenants (Jones-Correa, 2000; Gotham, 2000), redlining (Rothstein, 2017; Orlando, 2021), urban renewal (Hyra, 2012), and discriminatory mortgage lending practices (Taylor, 2019) have fueled racial segregation and low homeownership rates for African American households long before the Great Recession. Some housing policymakers are concerned that Wall Street-backed investors’ growing control of SFRs undermine availability and affordability of affordable housing for owner occupancy (Senate Bill 3402 and House Bill 9246, congress.gov n.d.), further widening the existing racial gaps in homeownership and wealth. Recent research investigating metro Atlanta shows that institutional investors intensively targeted majority-Black neighborhoods with strong rental market potential (Charles, 2020a; Coven, 2023), shrinking Black families’ homeownership rates (An, 2023).
Some scholars also worry that the financialization of the SFR market is another manifestation of a century-long racial capitalism that extracts and transfers wealth in the form of home equity from local minority communities (Fields & Raymond, 2021) to global capital markets (Charles, 2020a). In the absence of corporate investors, individual homebuyers could have been able to secure a home as a foundation for generational wealth building. Consequently, practitioners and scholars are increasingly sensitive about geographically concentrated SFR activities in minority-majority neighborhoods across the country.
Concerns are not just about reduced homeownership for families of color. Corporations, especially institutional scale investors, have an advantage in information about real estate market trends and are equipped with financial liquidity via securitization. They could target homes that would be otherwise sold to first-time homebuyers, increasing competition for homebuying during a time of inventory scarcity while worsening housing affordability (Fields & Vergerio, 2022; Coven, 2023; Kasakove, 2022; Whoriskey et al., 2021; cf. Garriga et al., 2022). However, the National Rental Home Council (NRHC), an industry trade group representing institutional SFR investors, contends that these big corporations provide a much-needed supply of rental housing (e.g. also see Coven, 2023). NRHC also reports that their investments have generated $4.39 billion in localized economic growth as of their most recent figure from 2015 (National Rental Home Council, n.d.). Yet, An (2022)’s study shows that institutional SFR investors within the 29-county Atlanta metro  caused $4.9 billion in financial loss by pushing homebuyers out of the market and shrinking homeownership between  2007 and 2016. Austin (2022)’s work, focusing on institutional SFR investors in six counties within Atlanta metro during 2010-2021, also provides a ballpark estimate of reduced annual property tax revenues by $4.1 billion nationwide via the investors’ successful tax appeals.
While institutions own only a small fraction of the national market, much of this activity has concentrated on Sunbelt regions with the Atlanta being one of the hottest markets (Immergluck, 2018; Goodman et al., 2023; Seymour et al., 2023; Shelton & Seymour 2023; Mills et al. 2019; Lambie-Hanson et al. 2022; Charles, 2022a, 2022b; Colburn et al. 2021). These regions and cities are known to have weak tenant protections (Fields & Vergerio, 2022) and mortgage markets for nonwhites, while experiencing a rapid home value appreciation and economic growth (Immergluck, 2018; An, 2023). Atlanta provides a valuable case study as a corporate-dominant SFR market with a wide diversity of neighborhoods in its core. According to Goodman et al. (2023)’s estimation, institutional investors (having more than 100 properties nationwide) owned one-third of all SFR properties in metro Atlanta in 2022. Existing research shows that the geographical concentration of institutionally owned SFRs is even more salient at the neighborhood level within the metro area with a strong presence in minority-majority communities (Charles, 2020a; An, 2023; Coven, 2023).
This paper examines the neighborhood-level impacts of corporate-driven SFR activities from 2010 to 2021, focusing on home equity as a key component of household wealth. Using a case study approach, we analyze the largest urban city and county in Georgia. We propose a framework that quantifies the impact of corporate SFR business on neighborhood wealth, tracking their property buying, renting, and selling activities. Core to our framework is the hypothesis that corporate investors extract value by buying at a lower and selling at a higher price when transacting with individuals relative to the rest of the market. We further expect that the relative scale of value extraction is greater in communities of color compared to predominantly white neighborhoods, given a higher concentration of corporate SFR investment in minority-majority neighborhoods, as indicated by the literature and previous studies of the Atlanta metro.
Our hedonic regressions and empirical analysis leverages parcel and sales data for the Atlanta City over 12 years, creating a complete picture of the detached SF home market. These analyses support both hypotheses. We also find that the City of Atlanta experienced $1.25 billion of wealth loss due to corporate SFR business during the study period. In certain African American majority neighborhoods, the average loss amounts to nearly 4% of the combined income of all households in the neighborhood, revealing the significance of its impact.  
	While documenting downstream effects of institutional SFR investors, such as those on crimes and evictions, has gained traction in the current literature (e.g. Gurun et al., 2023; Billings & Soliman, 2023; Raymond et al., 2018; Immergluck et al., 2020; Gomory, 2022), the efforts to quantify their direct economic impact in the housing market has been limited to the metrics like housing prices of nearby properties or overall rents of impacted neighborhoods (Coven, 2023; Smith & Liu, 2020; Mills et al., 2019; Lambie-Hanson et al., 2022; Garriga et al., 2023; Ganduri et al., 2023; Austin, 2022). This body of research generally suggests that institutional SFR investors contribute to a rise in localized housing prices and rents, making it harder for individuals to purchase a new home or afford the existing homes.2 
However, such findings alone do not directly describe the aggregate financial gain or loss within communities affected by corporate housing investors. We therefore develop a framework and methodology to quantify the financial impact of corporate-driven SFR investment activities within neighborhoods. Since home equity makes up most of the wealth for a typical American family, when aggregated at the neighborhood level, we view the aggregated loss of individual home equity equivalent to the loss in community wealth. Notably, this framework enables us to understand which neighborhoods have been more or most impacted by corporate SFR activities and by which types of investor activities.
Our framework analyzes key activities in which a corporate investor may exploit their unique market advantages to extract community wealth. During these corporate investors’ SFR business activities—home purchase, rental, and sale—the yield does not stay in local communities, but it is distributed to global (i.e. non-local) shareholders of corporations. We track the sum of financial gain made by corporate housing investors during these business activities.
In applying our framework to an extensive data set of county tax parcel (approximately 2.4 millions of records for parcel-year observations) and city sales records (more than 50,000 transactions) in Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia, we expand the typical temporal scope of SFR research to uncover cumulative impacts; analyzing multiple years of county tax parcel records is computationally costly since researchers must deal with every parcel within a jurisdiction. Yet it is a more effective approach to track corporate SFR ownership than only using transaction records as most prior research has done (e.g. Messamore, 2023; An, 2023; cf. Charles 2020a). Moreover, we develop a methodology to identify the corporate investors during their buying, owning, and selling activities that are often executed under different business names. Applying our methodology, we combine both types of tax parcel and sales data to gather a comprehensive outlook.
Framework
We seek to isolate wealth gain (or loss) that uniquely benefits corporate actors owning SFRs, meaning we identify a portion of neighborhood wealth that corporations extracted but which  individual home buyers or owners did not. We only consider wealth or financial gains extracted as a direct consequence of investor transaction and presence, not the total monetary returns of SFRs as Demers and Eisfeldt (2022) have estimated previously. A standard practice for measuring the gains or losses of housing investment involves tracking property price appreciation. If SFR properties were sold at a certain point, another relevant metric is the price differential between an initial purchase price and a later selling price; this information would include both price appreciation and any additional profits from the sale. However, housing price appreciation should benefit (via home equity or capital gains) or burden (via property taxes) all homeowners within a community, not just corporate landlords owning SFR properties. We therefore first focus on financial gains or losses from a transactional standpoint while accounting for any price appreciation effect via rental income channel.3In other words, we seek to isolate wealth growth (or loss) that uniquely benefits corporate SFRs, meaning we identify wealth corporations extracted, but not individual homeowners could. By making this distinction, we argue that this measure can be taken at face value without considering the complex interplay of market dynamics that may result in some spillover equity gain in and out of neighborhoods. Notably, our measure does not attempt to calculate the total monetary returns of SFRs, as Demers and Eisfeldt (2022) have estimated previously. Instead, we only consider wealth or financial gains extracted as a direct consequence of investor transaction and presence.To capture these specific activities of corporate-run SFR business, our framework focuses on three important points of time for all properties in question: 1) neighborhood entry (purchase), 2) rental business in a neighborhood (holding), and 3) exit (selling) from the neighborhood. As detailed in the next section, our methodology distinguishes between individual and corporate participants in a detached SF home transaction. For entry, we capture corporate purchases of SF properties from individuals. For exit, we capture the sale of corporate-owned SF properties to individuals. Lastly, for rental holdings, we track the duration of time that corporate landlords—who do not reside on the premises—own the SFR property. The distinction between transaction activities and rental operation is important as Demers and Eisfeldt (2022) find that net rental yields and house price appreciation (i.e. capital gains) each contributed a half of total financial returns for SFRs in the United States between 1986 and 2014.
Figure 1 shows our framework for capturing the purchase, rental, and sale of SFRs. Several points are worth discussing when applying this framework. First, for transactions (purchase and sale), we consider a property’s fair market value (FMV), assessed by county appraisers, as the baseline value. If a corporate buyer’s purchase price is lower than the FMV that year, we contend that the corporate entity has exerted its advantage for financial gain, extracting excess value from the community via the transaction.
While uncovering the specific mechanism(s) of such channels is beyond the scope of this study, one possibility is that corporate investors may systematically target the homes with structural issues that require additional spending on repairs upon acquisition. Goodman and Golding (2021), for instance, claim that institutional investors can benefit from economies of scale when buying up properties that need repairs, which affords corporate investors a comparative advantage relative to individuals who find it difficult to finance such properties. Simply put, corporate investors have more resources to complete repairs or upgrades more quickly for renting, a business model akin to flipping.
Also, even though such less desirable property and neighborhood conditions may already be reflected in the fair market value assessment, corporate investors could use various strategies, such as a full cash offer and swift closing, for more discounting, driving the final transaction prices down. Such resources give them unique advantages over individuals when buying properties. If a SFR property sells for more than FMV, we also classify this as an investor’s financial gain at the expense of the buyer’s home equity. To clarify, the only transactions included in our framework are corporate SF purchases from individuals and corporate SF sales to individuals, but not transactions between corporate actors nor those among individuals.
[Insert Figure 1 about here]
While the loss triggered by property purchasing and selling activities is straightforward, the procedure for property rental holding is not. It requires an understanding of the annual or monthly rental value of the SFR properties held by corporate landlords. When determining how much rent to charge a tenant, the industry rule of thumb suggests a charge for 1% of a home’s value for a monthly rent (Zillow, 2021). According to this formula, a home valued at $300,000, for example, would rent for $3,000 per month. However, the 1% rule does not hold in many places, especially in competitive rental housing markets. Moreover, the operating expenses, which typically range from 35 to 80 percent of the gross operating income (Zillow, 2012), should also be considered. 
Notably, Colburn et al. (2021)’s study tracks the operating and management (O&M) expenses for Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent, two of the largest institutional SFR investors, during 2014-2018 to show them ranging from 45 to 60 percent of rental revenue. Hence, a more conservative figure inclusive of O&M expense would be 0.5% of a home value, meaning the net operating income would be $1,500 per month for a home valued at $300,000. We use the latter number (i.e. 0.5%) to estimate the annual net operating income of SFR held by corporate landlords. Any corporate-owned, detached SF home is considered a rental. We track the period each rental is held and use the property’s annual fair market value (FMV) as its home value for a rough rental net income estimation. FMV captures renovations or other improvements to the property as well as price appreciation. Hence, our rental net income estimation also reflects these changes. Importantly, in estimating rental loss, we do not assume that all of those corporate-owned SFRs would have been owner-occupied otherwise. Rather, our approach mirrors a reality that the estimated net income is the amount extracted by the corporates in rent over our study period.
While absolute levels of corporate SFR-driven wealth loss are helpful to understand 
the scope of the loss or gain, they themselves are insufficient to derive meaningful implications when comparing place-based impacts. Various factors skew total wealth loss calculations, such as the number of parcels, median sales prices, and number of transactions across neighborhoods. These differences will magnify losses for large and wealthy neighborhoods with greater rents and sales prices. However, losses within these neighborhoods may be smaller relative to the overall size, sales prices, or the median household’s income. As our framework aims to emphasize comparative analysis between neighborhoods, we construct an additional measure to account for the factors above: wealth loss share. 
Admittedly, neighborhood residents do not directly pay for wealth loss, but we argue that it is a proxy for foregone wealth accumulation. In other words, this share of a household’s income should have otherwise gone to home equity or other asset-building within the community. Retaining such wealth may have had additional spillover benefits by paying dividends in interest or appreciation and by offering households the financial foundation to support family members, neighbors, local businesses, or other community and economic development activities. Instead, external corporate owners or shareholders likely exert market power to extract this wealth, while reducing homeownership and increasing rents as recent studies demonstrate (An, 2022; Billings & Soliman, 2023; Gurun et al., 2023). To this end, using household income information aggregated at the neighborhood level, we construct wealth loss share by dividing a community’s total wealth loss in a given year by the income generated by all households within that community in the same year as follows.

The analysis proceeds first by estimating corporate SFR value extraction. We expect, H1, that given market information and market power, corporate investors are able to extract value by buying at a lower price and selling at a higher price when transacting with individuals relative to the rest of the market. We further hypothesize, H2, that the relative scale of this value extraction is greater in communities of color compared to predominantly white neighborhoods.

Methods, Data, and Definitions
We obtained tax assessment (also called tax parcel) and property sales data from the Fulton
County Board of Assessors. The tax parcel data covers all parcels in Fulton County from 2010 to 2022, inclusive (about 2.6 million of parcel-year observations), and provides various information, including parcel identification (Parcel ID) number, parcel address, land use code, annual appraised value, fair market value, owner name, and owner mailing address. The property sales data provides information related to transactions, including Parcel ID, sale price, deed type, transaction date, grantor name (i.e. seller), and grantee name (buyer). The sales data we obtained contains all transactions occurring in calendar year 2010 to 2021, inclusive, equivalent to tax years 2011 to 2022. 
We note that if multiple properties in the county are purchased by the same buyer on the same date, the sale prices show the same amount, and they are effectively an aggregated price across those of all properties involved. We consider these cases as bulk or portfolio sales and divide the raw aggregated transaction price by the number of properties involved in the same deal to calculate an average price for each. Bulk of portfolio sales only make up 3.98% of all SF detached property sales within the City of Atlanta during our study period, but not surprisingly, 75% of all bulk sales are concentrated in transactions between corporate actors. In the next section, when we use hedonic regressions, we use this “adjusted” transaction price in the cases of bulk or portfolio sales.
The geometry of Atlanta’s Neighborhood Statistical Areas (NSAs) as defined by the city, along with American Community Survey (ACS) 2012-2021 data aggregated at the NSA level, was obtained from Neighborhood Nexus (Neighborhood Nexus, n.d.). NSAs are built from census blocks to match up with true neighborhood boundaries as closely as possible using Census geography (see the Online Appendix A).4 Because our data is from Fulton County, a small portion (6.5% in land area) of Atlanta in DeKalb County, is excluded. Entities were flagged as corporations if their name contained any of the common corporate identifiers (i.e. LLC, LLLP, LP, INC; see Online Appendix A for a full list). To reduce false positives, any identifier that may appear accidentally in a name, such as “INC”, was prepended or postended with a space. While we did not seek to manually verify all parcels and transactions in our data, we occasionally checked corporate entities and non-corporate actors in various analyses and gained confidence about the accuracy of our methods flagging corporate actors.
Any non-arm’s length transactions were removed from transaction based on sale classification codes provided by the county. Transactions in which the grantee or grantor was a government or bank were also excluded. These sales do not share the same implications as corporate SFRs exploiting their market advantages over individuals. Additionally, the inclusion of these sales adds ambiguity as they may heavily indicate blighted properties that were unlikely to become owner-occupied in the immediately following transactions.
We construct an address key to aggregate records to identify the same corporate investor owners of multiple SF homes. This key utilizes the principal components of an address that are likely to be consistent regardless of typos or formatting, including address number, zip code, and address string after removing prefixes and postfixes such as “ST” or “STREET”. These aggregated groups contain an address key and a list of associated owner names for that address. For instance, a record may contain the names “INVITATION HOMES” or “2018 1 IH BORROWER LP,” but both are connected to the address key “1717 MAIN 75201”. Please see Online Appendix A for further data processing details.
To classify investor scale, we determine the number of properties an investor owns across Fulton County each year. Like Messamore (2023) and An (2023), our data and ownership aggregation method enable the identification of corporations at multiple scales: small (under 10 properties), medium (10-49 properties), and large (50+ properties), whereas existing methods are, by and large, limited to identifying larger, national actors. After processing the data as described, we apply our framework to calculate equity loss totals.
Corporate Investors’ Advantages in Single-Family Home Transactions
To test our first hypothesis (H1) that corporate investors are able to extract value by buying at a lower and selling at a higher price when transacting with individuals relative to the rest of the market, we run a set of hedonic regressions for SF home sales within the City of Atlanta during 2010-2021. We use two dependent variables. The first is sale price (logged), and the second is sale price minus fair market value.
The notable feature of our model is that, based on our aforementioned methodology, we identify whether buyers and sellers are corporate entities or individuals, resulting in four possible categories in transaction dynamic, which all serve as focal independent variables: 1) corporate purchase from individual; 2) corporate purchase from (or selling to) another corporation; 3) corporate selling to individual; and 4) individual purchase from (or selling to) another individual. Each of the four categories is a mutually exclusive binary variable with the last being a reference (i.e. omitted) category. In the model, we further divide a category of “corporate selling to individual” into a) corporate purchase followed by selling to an individual within the same transaction year (most likely flipping cases) and b) the rest of corporate selling to individuals (i.e. most likely non-flipping transactions).
Our hedonic models have two units of analysis—property or transaction characteristics and neighborhood features. For the former, we include 1) a binary indicator variable representing whether a transaction is a typical (i.e. valid) sale or not, according to the Fulton County Board of Assessor’s criteria,5 2) log of living area square foot, 3) log of lot size in square foot, 4) total number of rooms, 5) number of baths, 6) effective age, and 7) its squared term to capture any non-linear relationship between age and property value.
Further, the model controls for a grade factor, assigned to each property by county appraisers. It represents the quality, type, style, or other judgment factors an appraiser believes are encompassed in the property. The grades range from highest magnitude to lowest in the following order: E+, E, E-, X+, X-, A+, A, A-, B+, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, and D-. We include them in the model as a set of binary dummy variables (i.e. grade factor fixed effects). An internal county code book writes: “Grades are not affected by condition or depreciation, and E grades are typically mansion and multi-million-dollar properties while D grades may include small, square, shot-gun style homes.” Hence, in addition to living area and lot size, the grade factor and effective age should capture the quality, condition, and style of properties. Next, we also include a categorical variable of “heating”, measuring if a property has central air, central/forced heat, non-central heating and cooling, or no central air or heat. 
The model considers the flipping transactions, and they are captured if there were at least two transactions of the same property within a same sale year where corporate purchase is followed by its selling to individuals. Additionally, we also control for the number of the same property sales within a sale year. This variable is recorded from 1 (i.e. one transaction within a same sale year, which makes up 90.87% of sales) to 2 (8.28%), 3 (0.79%), and 4 (0.06%). Lastly, the neighborhood-level features are captured by neighborhood fixed-effects, and the model controls for yearly fixed-effects.
We first report two models in Table 1 where the dependent variable is sale price logged. The first is panel least square regressions with neighborhood and year fixed effects. The second one is linear mixed models with neighborhood random effects and year-fixed effects. The results, which are nearly identical between the two models, show that (according to column 1) corporate investors purchase SF homes from individuals on average at a 36.4 percent lower price than what individual buyers pay to other individual sellers. Yet, when corporate investors sell those properties back to individuals, for non-flipped houses, they charge a price 7.14 percent higher on average than individual sellers do. Additionally, flipped houses achieve 15.1 percent higher prices from individual buyers than individual-to-individual transactions. Thus, the analysis confirm H1. Interestingly, compared to individual transactions, corporate actors pay 26.4 percent lower prices when they transact SF properties to other corporations. This result reflects both buying and selling as we do not track one type over the other since a corporate’s selling of a given property to another corporate is essentially a purchasing activity for the latter actor. Our model does not directly tell us why corporates buy or sell their properties at a discounted price when they transact with other corporate actors. However, we suspect a bulk sale—a deal of massive properties between corporate actors—could be one of the major reasons and we investigate this further below.  Overall, all other control variables show expected results consistent with the existing literature on housing asset pricing and hedonic regressions.
[Insert Table 1 about here]
One may question the results reported in Table 1, asking whether the type of properties corporate housing investors target is systematically different from those purchased by individual buyers. This question is reasonable considering the existing knowledge that some corporate actors tend to target properties that require structural repairs which are not mostly preferred by individual buyers (e.g. Goodman et al., 2023). While our model considers the most likely flipping transactions, and such control variables as a grading factor and effective age should address this concern to a great extent, it is still possible that the analysis may not be an apples-to-apples comparison. 
To address this concern, we next use a different dependent variable with the same model specification; here, for each property’s transaction, we compare its transaction price to its FMV determined by county appraisers. That is, we ask if corporate buyers pay less than individuals in comparison to a fair valuation of the property. In principle, FMV should capture any unobservable housing and neighborhood characteristics that are not necessarily captured by hedonic features and neighborhood fixed or random effects in our model. Therefore, this dependent variable provides additional evidence as to whether corporate housing investors have more institutional power and leverage in their asset pricing behaviors. Note that this dependent variable can be either negative or positive values. As such, unlike the previous models, we are unable to express the dependent variable in log. Instead, we leave them in terms of dollars. Accordingly, we do not take logs for both living area and lot size but measure them in 100 square foot to make the interpretations easier.
The results, reported in Table 2, show that, on average, corporate buyers pay about $21,000 less than a SF property’s fair market value compared to individual buyers. Also, consistent with the results in Table 1, when corporate investors sell those properties back to individual buyers, for non-flipped houses, they charge about $6,900 to $7,300 more than the properties’ fair market value, compared to the prices individual buyers agree to pay. Flipped properties’ corresponding prices are $20,100 to $20,500 higher than the fair market values. Hence, the analysis confirms H1 again with this alternative outcome variable.
For transactions between corporate actors, consistent with the previous, corporations acquire or sell properties to other corporations $13,600 to $14,000 cheaper than individuals transact with other individuals. As to why we observe lower prices for the corporate-to-corporate transactions, further analysis suggests that a bulk sale might be one of the reasons. That is, we sort out all 6,808 corporate-to-corporate transactions to order them from those with the largest deviation in the difference between price and fair market value to those with the smallest one. In doing so, we consider each property has different baseline fair market value, and so divide the outcome variable “price minus FMV” by its own FMV. We then compared the proportion of bulk sales between those above the median and the rest below the median. This descriptive analysis reveals that 32% in the top 50% of ) are bulk or portfolio sales, whereas it only makes up 15% for the bottom 50% of the distribution of the same metric. Simply put, corporations may sell multiple properties to other corporate buyers in a bulk deal, and when that occurs, they tend to sell those portfolios at lower prices.  
The control variables generally show results like those of the earlier models. Taken together, the results validate the major assumption of our proposed equity loss framework. In the following sections, we map out Atlanta’s underlying demographics and equity loss calculations due to corporate SFR business.

Wealth Loss
Contextualizing Atlanta’s Neighborhoods
Before we present neighborhood-level SFR portfolios, we visualize Atlanta’s spatial division along a historical boundary, the consequence of racially discriminatory planning decisions and economic development (Bayor, 1988). Figure 2 shows that this boundary crosses diagonally through the city from the top left to the bottom right. Beneath this line and using Downtown (marked “1”) as a central point, neighborhoods have a high proportion of non-Hispanic Black residents. Conversely, neighborhoods to the northeast of the boundary are predominantly non-Hispanic White. Household income follows the same divide, with neighborhoods to the south and west having comparatively lower median incomes than those in the north. In particular, the highest income earners are highly concentrated around Buckhead (marked “2”). Understanding neighborhood demographics is crucial in contextualizing the disparate concentration of corporate SFR portfolios and their associated financial impact.

Neighborhood-level Corporate Single-Family Rental Portfolios
On average, individuals owned 86% of SF parcels across Atlanta in 2022. However, in some neighborhoods to the south and west, individual ownership levels fall under 70%, as demonstrated by Figure 3. This pattern is reflected in corporate ownership: 15-20% 
of the SF stock in many of these same neighborhoods are owned by small corporations. While
corporations of all sizes tend to concentrate on the south and east of the city, large SFR owners have a higher ownership share in neighborhoods further out from Downtown. Higher concentrations of corporate ownership may supply these owners with disproportionate power to extract rents and profits from transactions in these neighborhoods.
[Insert Figure 3 about here]
Next, we analyze the geography of SF transactions between corporations and individuals, differentiating between purchases and sales. There are four resulting cases, as depicted in Figure 4. Transactions involving a corporate entity are concentrated beneath the historical divide. In many of these neighborhoods, the share of corporate purchases is between 15% and 25% but remains below 10% for other neighborhoods. A similar and stronger divide is observed for corporate-to-corporate sales, while the same but weaker pattern can be seen in corporate sales to individuals. Inversely, most transactions in comparatively wealthy and predominantly White neighborhoods are between individuals.
As our wealth loss framework only considers corporate purchases from individuals and corporate sales to individuals, we should expect equity loss to be more significant in neighborhoods to the south and east. More concretely, Figure 4 reveals that corporations are involved in a significant majority (about 70%) of all SF transactions in majority Black neighborhoods. Meanwhile, corporations are only involved in 30-40% of SF transactions in other neighborhoods.

Neighborhoods’ Wealth Loss by Corporate SFR Investors, Atlanta 2011-2021
Our framework considers wealth loss due to corporate purchases for less than FMV, 
corporate sales for greater than FMV, and estimated SFR net rental yields. We label these as 
purchase, sale, and rental loss, respectively. Total loss is the collective sum of these losses, and Figure 5 displays the losses across all years in the study period. The total wealth loss triggered by SFR corporate investors in Atlanta between 2011 and 2021 amounts to $1.25B in 2022 dollars. Stratifying the neighborhoods into majority-Black and those that are not, these sums are $681M (54.5%) and $568M (45.4%), respectively. As a baseline comparison, we sum the appraised value of SF properties across neighborhoods in 2022. Collectively, Atlanta’s SF parcels were appraised at $38.4B in 2022; majority-Black neighborhoods had a total SF value of $10.1B (26.3% of total) versus $28.3B (73.7%) for other neighborhoods.
Across all neighborhoods, purchase-driven wealth loss amounted to $77M (6%), whereas sale loss amounted to $472M (37%), and rental loss stood at $700M (56%). For majority-Black neighborhoods, the corresponding figures are $95M purchase loss (14%), $245M sale loss (36%), and $340M rental loss (50%). For non-majority-Black neighborhoods, these totals are 
$-18M (-3%),6 $226M (40%), and $359M (63%), respectively.
As expected, wealth loss from corporate purchases is concentrated south and east. In these neighborhoods, as demonstrated by the hedonic regressions in the preceding section, corporate investors typically paid well below FMV when acquiring SF properties from individuals. Meanwhile, sale loss concentrates heavily in a few neighborhoods with no spatially discernible pattern. Among these high sale loss neighborhoods, Grant Park and Ormewood Park may be classified as gentrifying: they have higher income households and a lower share of minority residents compared to neighboring areas.
	Finally, rental business-driven wealth loss concentrates heavily on northern neighborhoods with high property values. For instance, the Kingswood neighborhood has multiple properties owned by obscure holding companies with estimated annual rental yields above $500K. While we do not speculate on the nature of these high value, corporate-owned SF properties as this is beyond the scope of current research, we find that most of the loss within Atlanta’s northern neighborhoods (i.e. Buckhead) is due to rental loss. Wealth loss for neighborhoods to the south and east is driven disproportionately by purchase loss and, to a lesser extent, sale loss. Total wealth loss is greatest in the Buckhead area, followed closely by a subset of neighborhoods to the south and east.
Adjusted for inflation (in 2022 dollars), total wealth loss in Kingswood in the Buckhead area, the neighborhood with the greatest loss, was $44M, followed by Morningside/Lenox Park ($38M), North Buckhead ($36M), Grant Park ($36M), Chastain Park ($36M), Adair Park/Pittsburgh ($35M), Ormewood Park ($34M), and Bush Mountain ($32M). In contrast, Castleberry Hill/Downtown ($31K), Brookwood Hills ($547K), and Ardmore ($1.4M) had the least wealth loss. The median wealth loss across all neighborhoods is $11M, and the average wealth loss is $13M.
[Insert Figure 5 about here]
Standardizing Wealth Loss Between Neighborhoods
When standardizing wealth loss as a share of each neighborhood’s average household income, in Figure 6, we find that it is greatest in predominantly non-Hispanic Black and low-income neighborhoods to the south and close to Downtown, confirming our second hypothesis (H2) which states the relative scale of wealth extraction by corporate SFR investors is greater in communities of color compared to predominantly white neighborhoods. Specifically, between 2012 and 2021,7 the most impacted neighborhoods lost about 5% of the income they generated to corporate SFR investors every year.
While we cannot claim that most households in the community individually experienced a 5% loss of their wealth; certain households, especially renters and those directly involved in SF property transactions with corporate investors should have been more impacted than others. In particular, households who face sudden financial hardships may sell their properties to corporate investors at discounted prices as corporate SFRs often provide “all-cash, no-contingency offers.” Thus, households facing foreclosure, suddenly increasing tax bills, unexpected medical debt, or economic shocks, would be most susceptible to the tactics of corporate investors and likely bore the most significant losses. Additionally, renters who may have otherwise transitioned to homeownership should be disproportionately impacted.
Confirming H2, overall, majority-Black neighborhoods lost financial assets equivalent to 1.3% of the income they collectively generated during the study period, whereas the remaining neighborhoods lost 0.28% of their income due to corporate SFR business. As an illustrative example, take Bush Mountain, a majority-Black neighborhood with the highest loss relative to its average household income. In 2018 (tax year 2019), the year Bush Mountain suffered the highest loss proportional to its income, the average household income was $40,524 and the wealth loss share amounted to $4,341. Such a level of wealth extraction (10.7% of income) might disempower and prevent families from pathways to homeownership and generational wealth-building. Over all years, Bush Mountain’s average wealth loss was approximately 4% of the total income it generated throughout the study period.
Limitations
Before we conclude this paper, it is important that we fully acknowledge some limitations. First, while we validate a major assumption of our framework, we cannot robustly validate the implied counterfactual; our framework only measures what has occurred, accepting that corporate SFR investors have been present. In particular, we cannot directly determine whether owner-occupiers would have purchased the homes acquired by corporate investors in the absence of their business. These properties may have remained vacant and reduced the overall condition of the neighborhood. Corporate investment could have prevented other forms of wealth loss in such cases. While it is difficult to speculate on such scenarios, we admit that our framework does not consider such counterfactuals. 
Still, given their presence over a decade in our study area, we believe that our framework design appropriately measures the wealth loss to neighborhoods that corporate SFR investors have caused. Notably, our framework relies on fair market value, which should account for the home’s desirability as a baseline measure. Furthermore, in testing H1, we have shown that corporate investors purchase homes at lower prices from individuals yet sell those properties at a higher premium back to individuals, compared with individual-to-individual transactions, and such pattern was also the case when we jointly considered transaction price and fair market value. 
Also, inherent in our framework is a bias towards homeownership. For many American families, homeownership is essential to build wealth. However, renting can offer advantages over ownership for some families, and in some situations, including no or few maintenance costs. Additionally, certain families must rent to build credit or save for a down payment. Increased access to stable rental housing likely benefits a community, but not at the expense of forgone homeownership or equity loss caused by corporate market power.
	On the topic of foreclosure, bank, and government sales, our analysis excludes these properties despite them contributing a large portion of corporate SFR investment, usually consisting of bulk sales especially in the aftermath of the Great Recession. While a separate methodology would be more appropriate to understand the impact of these transactions on neighborhoods wealth, our estimate would serve as a conservative one since these are still properties that the corporates obtained at prices well-below market, operated them as rentals, and ultimately sold some portion. Instead, our framework centers around direct interactions between corporate investors and individuals rather than the complex dynamics of corporate SFR investors within the housing market, and hence produces a conservative estimate than frameworks that also consider foreclosure, bank, and government sales.
We also note a few limitations related to data availability. While our study covers a span over 2010 and 2021, we do not have more recent data, nor do we include neighborhoods outside the core city. However, some areas within the Atlanta MSA but outside of the core city contain a significantly higher concentration of corporate SFRs (An, 2022; Shelton & Seymour, 2023). There is also the added complexity of COVID-19 and reduced interest rates, which spurred a temporary increase in SFR investment in recent years (Fields & Vergerio, 2022). Future research can examine the latest trends using the most recent data.
Lastly, our framework and measurement are one of the many possible approaches that researchers can use to quantify the impact of corporate SFR business. While our approach, anchored on housing transactions and rental business, is straightforward to understand, it does not directly measure or incorporate such welfare effects of corporate SFR investors as overall neighborhood quality change (e.g. crime) or corporate landlords’ rent charging, property management or eviction filings to list a few. It also does not consider the impact on property tax revenues a neighborhood generates by corporate landlords’ property tax appeals (Austin, 2022).
Conclusion
This paper develops a novel framework to quantify the financial loss wrought by corporate SFR investors at a neighborhood level. We apply this framework to the City of Atlanta’s 95 core neighborhoods, analyzing tax parcel data and SF home sales between 2010 and 2020. Foundational to our framework is the view that corporations have unique market power, which they exploit to extract excess profits from local communities via SF transactions and rental business. 
We use hedonic regressions to test this hypothesis. Our findings indicate that corporate buyers pay 36% less when buying a SF home from individuals compared to transactions between individuals, controlling for property and neighborhood characteristics. Compared to fair market value, corporate buyers pay $21,000 less than individual homebuyers. Likewise, when corporate investors sell SF homes back to individuals, they sell for a 7% premium compared to a similar transaction between individuals. For flipped homes, they charge 15% premiums to individuals.  Relative to fair market value, these premiums are equivalent to $7,000 (non-flipped houses) and $20,000 (flipped properties) over sale by individual sellers. 
Analyzing corporate SFR portfolios within Atlanta over 2010-2021, we find that a corporation is involved in about 70% of all SF transactions in majority-Black neighborhoods, double the rate of other neighborhoods. Additionally, corporate SFR investors tend to own between 15 and 30% of SF parcels within majority-Black neighborhoods; for other neighborhoods, corporate ownership tends to stay around or below 10%.
Applying our framework, we identify $1.25B in lost wealth within Atlanta neighborhoods over the recent decade. Majority-Black neighborhoods lost $681M (54.5% of the total), while other neighborhoods lost $568M (45.4%). As a baseline, majority-Black neighborhoods only possessed 26.3% of Atlanta’s collective SF value (sum of appraised values) as of 2022. Investigating investor activity types further, we find that majority-Black neighborhoods had significantly more purchase-driven wealth loss, whereas other neighborhoods had slightly higher levels of sale-driven loss and considerably higher rental loss. As to community wealth, majority-Black neighborhoods lost wealth equivalent to 1.3% of the income they generated during the study period with the most impacted one showing 4% of wealth loss relative to their income, whereas non-majority Black neighborhoods only lost 0.28%. These figures indicate that majority-Black communities suffered a disproportionate amount of wealth loss due to corporate SFR activities.
Policies restricting corporate SFR business have been proposed at various levels of government due to increasing awareness of their impacts amongst researchers, policymakers, and the public alike. Our framework uncovers that a significant portion of harm caused by corporate investors falls outside the scope of the rental activity. Even if policy prevents corporate landlords from continuing to rent homes, much of the damage has already been done. However, no policy approaches recognize this challenge and attempt to remedy past harms with place-based intervention approaches. This paper is motivated by the perspective that policy efforts should focus on returning previously lost wealth to communities rather than solely preventing such type of corporate land-lording activity. Importantly, this framework provides tools for practitioners at a local level. Using publicly available data, practitioners can apply our framework to identify the neighborhoods within their cities or regions that have been most impacted by corporate SFRs and by which investment activities.
Future research can extend this foundation to uncover the mechanisms by which corporations exploit their market power and extract excess wealth. For instance, we suspect that the weak mortgage market within these neighborhoods makes it easier for corporate investors to out-compete individuals; along with racial and income barriers, many banks do not provide mortgages for homes worth less than $150,000 (Maguze et al., 2023), which are frequent in these neighborhoods. If relevant data exists, additional insights may be gleaned by tracking the relationship between direct measures of household well-being and community wealth loss. Researchers may also further investigate the geography of external ownership and financial flows: we demonstrate that wealth flows out of some neighborhoods but not where it is flowing. Similarly, research can investigate if investor scale and type is a significant factor in wealth loss and neighborhood trajectory. Finally, our framework can be applied to other metropolitan areas with high corporate SFR investment levels. As our framework operates at such a local level, we expect it may reveal patterns unique to specific local or metropolitan areas.

Additional NSA Information
The Atlanta Regional Commission accomplished this NSA delineation with assistance of the city’s planning department. Their research team looked at imagery and zoning to resolve questions about assignment, and they consulted the Neighborhood Planning Units (NPUs), which are community-based local government entities in Atlanta. The designated NSAs were required to have a minimum population of 2,000; areas not meeting the threshold were combined with neighboring areas within the same NPU to reach the minimum population size. Every census block within the City of Atlanta was assigned to NSA on one-to-one basis.

Parcel Data Cleaning
Step 1 (parcel and sales data): drop non-SF and complete duplicates. As our interest lies in single-family detached properties, we keep only SF detached properties by filtering the relevant land use code in both datasets before merging.

Notes: A small subset of parcels are missing tax records for at least one year throughout the 13 year period. The total number of missing entries is 18,722 out of 2,785,447. This data loss is not a consequence of processing but rather of incomplete records from Fulton County. While noteworthy, we believe this will only have a negligible impact on the results. At worst, the calculations will undercount; we consider this acceptable.

Step 2 (parcel data): drop rows with essential values missing. To facilitate further analysis steps, we drop records with empty owner address strings. Some additional string cleaning is later applied to the parcel owner’s address, as detailed in the following section, but no additional rows were dropped during that process.

Step 3 (parcel data) and Step 2 (sales data): geocoding.

Step 4 (parcel data): retain only the main structure on each parcel. Within tax assessor data, we consider the Parcel ID and tax year columns collectively as the unique key. However, the format of Fulton County’s assessor data allows for a single parcel to have multiple records in one year if there are multiple structures on the parcel. For SF parcels, these additional structures are ADUs. As ADUs are outside the scope of our research question, we retain only the record with the largest living area square footage— the main structure— for each key.

Sales Data Cleaning
Steps 1-2: see equivalent steps for the parcel data.

Step 3 (sales data): drop non-arm’s length transactions. Additionally, we drop non-arms length sales. Retaining such sales would inappropriately skew calculations because the sales price is unlikely to reflect any true market condition. We consider a non-arms length sale as any sale classified with one of the following Saleval codes: T (sale price <= 1,000), G (gift), 6F (quitclaim), 4 (related individuals or corporations). Saleval codes, defined by the Fulton County Board of Assessors, will be discussed further in the next section.

Step 4 (sales data): retain only one record per unique transaction. Sales data also contains some irrelevant duplicate records on the sale date, Parcel ID, and sale price unique key. These duplicates occur when the entire row is identical except for the Saleval code (i.e. the type of transaction). We drop any duplicate rows where sale date, Parcel ID, and sales price are identical (11,416 records), retaining only the first record.

Step 5 (sales data): replace sales price for multi-parcel transactions to reflect average price per parcel. Multi-parcel sales, which are of special interest as a common tool for investors to acquire a bulk of properties, require an additional cleaning step. As usual in other proprietary real estate transaction data, in Fulton’s sales records, every parcel involved in a multi-parcel sale has the total transaction amount recorded as the sales price, rather than the price paid on a per parcel basis. For such cases, we divide the transaction price by the total number of parcels involved in the multi-parcel sale. While this method does not perfectly capture the value each individual parcel brought to the sale, it effectively averages out these differences.

Step 6 (sales data): drop government and bank sales. Finally, we exclude transactions in which the grantee or grantor is a government institution or bank. These sales do not share the same implications as investors profiting from SFRs and thus are excluded from our framework.
